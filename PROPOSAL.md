# Viciniti

## Project Description

### Our application is called Viciniti. It matches users who consume delivered services and products with corresponding providers in a way that facilitates piggybacking multiple deliveries together in order to create efficiencies and cost savings for both parties and drive more sales for the providers.

## Application Description

The purpose of the application is to make the delivery of products and services to consumers more efficient by generating orders/appointments that are grouped closely toghther geographically. We do this by pushing disount options to users based on their proximity to existing orders/appointments with a given service/product provider. This allows the providers to generate more business while reducing delivery costs and it allows users to get better pricing.
