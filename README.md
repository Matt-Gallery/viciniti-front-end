## Project Description

### Our application is called Closet Cloud. It provides recommendations to users on what outfit to wear based on their saved wardrobe items and the weather forecast.

## Application Description

The purpose of the application is to make it easy for users to decide what to wear each day based on the weather forecast.  It will allow users to build a database of items they have in their wardrobe and some parameters for what weather they prefer to wear each item in and then based on the weather forecast it will propse outfit options for the day.
